I personally don't have that great of knowledge in handling files in GitHub.

Here is what, my outline is and I don't know if it will work.

1.All the classes will be separate class files under the same package "Parking lot"
2.There will be a main public class called "Parking lot" where all the working happens
3.If the above plan does not work due to certain incompatibilities or my short-sightedness, we will copy all the code on just one java file,

4. Let's start working as soon as possible. We are already running of time. Other team have made written around 500 lines of codes.
